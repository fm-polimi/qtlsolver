= Squared signal =

An interested sample producing a squared signal where edges are not constrained to be left-closed nor left-open.

:bound 10

:def ax1 (G_i+ 0 (-> (G_ee 0 1 p) (G_ee 1 2 (!! p))))
:def ax2 (G_e+ 0 (-> (G_ee 0 1 (!! p)) (G_ee 1 2 p)))
:def ax3 (G_ee 0 1 p)

:formula (&& ax3 (&& ax2 ax1))
}}} 



= Finitely variability =

The following formula is unsat because it is satisfible only over non finitely variable signals.

:qtl
:bound 10

:def ax1 (G_e+ 0 (|| (U p p) (U (!! p) (!! p))))
:def ax2 (G_e+ 0 (|| (S p p) (S (!! p) (!! p))))

:formula (!! (&& ax1 ax2))
