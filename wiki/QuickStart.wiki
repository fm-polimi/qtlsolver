#summary The fastest way to use qtlsover


= Installing =

*qtlsolver* requires 

  * antlr3.5 libraries (you can download antlr-3.5-complete.jar from http://www.antlr3.org/download.html)

  * Zot toolkit that you can find at http://code.google.com/p/zot/
    * Zot requires a Common Lisp interpreter (e.g., sbcl) and Z3 SMT-solver (4.0 better)
    * Zot is supposed to be "system-wide" and runnuble by `zot' command line 



* Remark:* antlr3.5 library is already included in qtlsolver.jar (Downloads section).



= Example =

Here you can find a simple example of a QTL formula producing a square signal 'p'.


{{{
:qtl
:bound 10

:def ax1 (G_e+ 0 (-> p (F_ee 0 2 (G_ee 0 1 (!! p)))))
:def ax2 (G_e+ 0 (-> (!! p) (F_ee 0 2 (G_ee 0 1 p))))
:def ax3 (G_ie 0 1 p)

:formula (&& ax3 (&& ax1 ax2))
}}}

Save it in a .tl file (e.g., wave.tl) and run `java -jar qtlsolver.jar wave.tl --sat`. 

You will get

  * file `dict.txt` where the formulae involved are listed and

  * file `filename.cltl` containing the translation for each formula appearing in `dict.txt`.

*qtlsolver* produces two output: either sat or unsat. 
In the case of *sat*, `output.hist.smt` contains the bounded model satisfying the QTL formula.
The `.cltl` file is always provided.
If `--sat` is omitted, the dictionary file and `filename.cltl` are produced but SMT resolution is not performed.
