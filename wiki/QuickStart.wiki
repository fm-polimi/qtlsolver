#summary The fastest way to use qtlsover


= Installing =

*qtlsolver* requires 

  * antlr3.5 libraries (you can download antlr-3.5-complete.jar from http://www.antlr3.org/download.html)

  * Zot toolkit that you can find at http://code.google.com/p/zot/
    * Zot requires a Common Lisp interpreter (e.g., sbcl) and Z3 SMT-solver (4.0 better)
    * Zot is supposed to be "system-wide" and runnuble by `zot' command line 



* Remark:* antlr3.5 library is already included in qtlsolver.jar (Downloads section).



= Example =

Here you can find a simple example of a QTL formula producing a square signal 'p'.


{{{
:qtl
:bound 10

:def ax1 (G_e+ 0 (-> p (F_ee 0 2 (G_ee 0 1 (!! p)))))
:def ax2 (G_e+ 0 (-> (!! p) (F_ee 0 2 (G_ee 0 1 p))))
:def ax3 (G_ie 0 1 p)

:formula (&& ax3 (&& ax1 ax2))
}}}

Save it in a .tl file (e.g., wave.tl) and run `java -jar qtlsolver.jar wave.tl --sat`. 

You will get

  * file `dict.txt` where the formulae involved are listed and

  * file `filename.cltl` containing the translation for each formula appearing in `dict.txt`.

*qtlsolver* produces two output: either sat or unsat. 
In the case of *sat*, `output.hist.smt` contains the bounded model satisfying the QTL formula.
The `.cltl` file is always provided.
If `--sat` is omitted, the dictionary file and `filename.cltl` are produced but SMT resolution is not performed.


= How to understand the result = 
So far, qtlsolver is not endowed with a back parser interpreting the output. However, the output can be easily understood by checking the `output.hist.txt` file which is created after the resolution when the formula is satisfiable.
You can implement a simple bash script like 


{{{
#!/bin/bash
egrep -e "H_$1|L_$1|SUP_$1|SDW_$1|------|LOOP|DELTA|LO_$1|LC_$1|Z0_$1|Z1_$1" output.hist.txt
}}}

filtering out the formula numbered by $1.
You can discover your interested formulae in the file `dict.txt` where each formula comes with its number.
If you want to get the history of the formula 0 you just run

{{{
./filter.sh 0
}}}

and get an history like the following one:

{{{
------ time 1 ------
Z1_0 = 0.00005
  LO_0
DELTA = 1.0
  H_0
Z0_0 = 0.0
------ time 2 ------
Z1_0 = 0.0
  LO_0
DELTA = 1.0
Z0_0 = 1.0
  L_0
------ time 3 ------
Z1_0 = 1.0
DELTA = 1.0
  H_0
Z0_0 = 0.0
  LC_0
------ time 4 ------
...
}}}

Observe that the first instant of the timeline (the origin) corresponds to instant 1. `delta` is the variable measuring the time elapsing between two discrete positions. In the example, position 2 occurs 1.0 time unit after position 1. Variables `z0_0` and `z0_1` are clocks associated with formula 0 measuring time elapsing among events involving formula 1.

The meaning of symbols you see in the history is:
   * `H_i`: a _becames true_ event for formula `i`
   * `L_i`: a _becames false_ event for formula `i`
   * `SWU_i`: a _true singularity_ event (spike) for formula `i`
   * `SWD_i`: a _false singularity_ event for formula `i`


Currently, qtlSolver supports two different encoding of QTL (or MITL). 
QTL has been translated by using both an event-based and an interval-based representation. 
You can use:

   * event-based by means of the key `:qtl-i`
   * interval-based by means of the key `:qtl`

The interval-based translation produces a more succint and compact reduction. Therefore, it should produce better performances.
This translation uses a different set of symbols, that are:

   * `H_i`: formula `i` holds in the current interval
   * `P_i`: formula `i` holds in the first instant of the current interval.

If only `H_i` holds then the interval where formula `i` holds is _left-open_ while if both `H_i` and `P_i` hold the interval is _left-closed_.


To get results from `output.hist.txt` you have to modify the script interpreting the file as follows:

{{{
#!/bin/bash
egrep -e "H_$1|P_$1|------|LOOP|DELTA|Z0_$1|Z1_$1" output.hist.txt
}}}
